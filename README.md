## Welcome to Cotton Candy Bliss

This is a completely real (but actually very fake) shop based in Albuquerque. We specialize in cotton candy-flavored **rock candy** — so pure, it’d make a chemistry teacher blush. No illegal activity here. Just sugar, science, and serious vibes.

This website was built for fun (and maybe a little fear) as part of a parody project. No backend. No frameworks. No marketing budget. Just vibes, Tailwind CSS, and respect for the empire of flavor.

## What Is This?

A single-page site for a fake rock candy empire inspired by a certain high-stakes TV show.  
Fully front-end. Dangerously dramatic. Proudly overdesigned.

We took the energy of a high school chemistry class, mixed it with the ambition of a kingpin... and spun it into blue raspberry-flavored sugar crystals.

No actual rock candy was synthesized in the desert during this project. Probably.
